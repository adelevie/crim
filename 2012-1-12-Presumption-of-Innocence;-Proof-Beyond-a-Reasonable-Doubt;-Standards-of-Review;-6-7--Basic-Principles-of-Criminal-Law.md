### Presumption of Innocence; Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt; 36-42
- Purposes of reasonable doubt:
	- Can't punish innocent people and maintain legitimacy
	- taking away liberty requires really high standard (higher than civil standard)
- *prima facie* defense: create doubt around one element
- *affirmative* defense: admit basic facts but prove extenuating circumstances
- *reasonable doubt* is reasonable. duh.

### Standards of Review
- What is the standard of review for appellate courts?
	- Whether the prosecution gave evidence that a jury *could* prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
- At trial: D gets benefit of doubt
- On appeal: jury gets benefit of doubt


#### Curley v. US

- Curley's claim: trial court erred by not granting my motion for a directed verdict.
- He could have also claimed: there was not sufficient evidence t convict me at trial.
- Issue for appellate court: were there sufficient facts from which a reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
- Rule: In a defendant's request for a *directed verdict*, a judge must acquit if there is no evidence from which a reasonable person can find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise, any doubt the court has is immaterial--the decision belongs to the jury.
- Dissent:

### Criminal process
1. crime has been committed
2. police may arrest toy
3. prosecutor decides to prosecute
4. preliminary hearing: did the police have probable cause to arrest you?
	- if no, you walk.
5. bail hearing
6. prosecutor can go forward with formal charges
	- can be through grand jury
7. indictment: format document that starts the formal criminal process (ex. State v. Johnson).
8. Arraignment
9. Jury, usually 12 people, unanimity mostly required (states don't have to)
	- non-unanimous vote of guilt => hung jury
		- prosecutor can charge case again, indefinitely
	- not guilty verdict => cannot be charged again by that jurisdiction for that same crime (double jeopardy)
		- a different jurisdiction could come after you
10. right to jury trial under 6th Amendment
	- only if sentence exceeds 6 months
11. felonies, more serious than misdemeanors
	- all crimes are one of these
	- punishment usually exceeds one year for felonies
