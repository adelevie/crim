### Acting Voluntarily versus acting involuntarily; the unconsciousness defense; 146-154

### Elements of Actus Reus
- voluntary act/failure to act
- causes
- social harm
	- the definition of the crime
	- punishes a conduct, a result, or both
		- ex. DUI punishes *conduct* of driving while intoxicated
		- ex. murder punishes *result*
	- comprises the entire definition of the crime statute except for the *Mens Rea* (mental state)
	- *attendant circumstances*: situation or a circumstance that must be present in conjunction with the prohibited conduct or result, in order to constitute the crime.
	- part of the Actus Reus
	
#### Ex. 1 - MPC 210.1 Criminal Homicide (p. 1016)
- Actus Reus:
	- causing the death of another human being
	- *attendant circumstances*: death has to be of *another* *human being*

#### Ex. 2
- It is a crime to kill another human being by means of a bomb
	- ^this entire thing is the Actus Reus
	- this statute punishes a conduct or a result or both?
		- both
			- result: death of a human being
			- cause: conduct of using a bomb
- attendant circumstances:
	- a bomb
	- a human being
	- another human being

#### Ex. 3
- It's an offense to drive an automobile while intoxicated
	- entire thing is the Actus Reus
- punishes conduct
- attendant circumstances
	- intoxication
	- automobile
	- We don't count driving, because it is the conduct that is punished. We only look at the *other* things that must occur with driving for it to be a crime.

#### Ex. 4
- Breaking and entering the dwelling house of another at night is a crime
- Actus Reus: the whole thing
- Punishes conduct: breaking and entering
- attendant circumstances
	- another's dwelling house
	- at night

### MPC 2.02 (p. 988) General Requirements of Culpability
- Four mental states
	- *purposely*
	- *knowingly*
	- *recklessly*
	- *negligently*
	
### Requirements for a criminal statue
- Every criminal statue must have an Actus Reus
- Every criminal statue must have a Mens Rea (guilty mind)
- ex. if you want to kill your brother, state must prove that when you did kill your brother, you had the intent to kill him
	- if you accidentally crash, and kill your brother, you are not guilty of murder, since you did not have the appropriate mental state (mens rea) when the act occurred.

### Regina v. Cunningham (p. 190)
- Statute: whoever maliciously administers or causes to be administered by any other person any noxious thing thereby endangering the life of any other person is a crime
	- Actus Reus: everything except "maliciously"
	- Punishes conduct: cause to be administered
	- Punishes result: endangering the life of another person
	- Attendant circumstances
- Facts: man pulls gas meter off for 8 shillings; poisons people from the gas
- Trial court's jury instructions: malicious means wicked--he had no business pulling the gas meter off the wall (Culpability approach: you've done something bad, so we'll punish you)
	- doesn't require intent to administer gas to his mother in law endangering her life
- Elemental approach (MPC approach)
	- applies the Mens Rea to each element

	`return :crime unless elements.map {|e| e.mens_rea? == :malicious}.include?(false)`

	- easier to convict using culpability approach
		- all you have to do is show he was wicked in something
	- tougher to show he intended several elements
	- Appeals Court:
		- malicious can mean wicked, but it can also be acting recklessly as to whether such harm should occur or not
			- ex. did the accused foresee that a crime would happen, and then did he go ahead and to it anyway?
	- could the prosecutor have focused on the omission?
		- failure to shut off the valve
		- probably not, because you still need a duty (duty is required for omission liability)
- Applying MPC 2.02
	- (1) Min. Requirements of Culpability: knowingly/purposely/recklessly/or negligently must apply to every material element
		- what is a material element?
		- what is an element?
	- (2)
		- (a) *purposely*
			- (i) conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result
				- to be guilty, it would have to be his conscious objective to administer a noxious substance, *and* that he consciously wanted to endanger another person's life
			- *and*
			- (ii) aware of attendant circumstances, or believes/hopes they exist
				- he must believe/hope/be aware that what he is administering is gas *and* that it is to another person
					- when he removed the gas meter, he know gas would seep out, that it would reach another person, and that it would endanger her life
			- prosecutors can use *"natural probable consequences"* doctrine to prove purpose
				- jury can presume natural and probable consequences of defendant's conduct
		- (b) *knowingly*
			- (i) conduct *or* attendant circumstances: aware that his conduct is of that nature
			- *and*
			- (ii) aware that conduct will cause such a result
			- to show guilt, he'd have to be "aware" that he was administering gas to the lady, and "practically certain" that she would be endangered as a result
		- (c) *recklessly*
			- consciously disregards a *substantial* and *unjustifiable* risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct
			- gross deviation from the standard of conduct of that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation
			- two steps: aware of risk, then disregard the risk
		- (d) *negligently*
			- he should have been aware, but wasn't (key difference between recklessly)
