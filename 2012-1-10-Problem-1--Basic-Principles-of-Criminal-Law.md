### Problem 1

- Joe Wilson’s wife, Alison, recently told him she wanted a divorce, and Joe has been despondent ever since.  One night, about two weeks ago, Joe went to his local bar.  Brooding out loud about his loss, Joe voiced the suspicion to the bartender that his wife was seeing someone else.  He proceeded to drink heavily, until the bartender would not serve him anymore.  The bartender later testified that she heard him say, “If I can’t have her, nobody can.”

- Joe then left the bar and drove to the apartment he had been renting, where he picked up a handgun he had owned for years and frequently carried for protection.  After drinking a few more beers, he decided to drive to the family home and talk Alison into returning to him.  When he arrived, the light in the bedroom was on.  Joe quietly let himself into the house and entered the bedroom.  He found Alison in bed with his best friend Freddie.  Seemingly startled and frightened, Alison fired a shot from her own trusty handgun, which was beside the bed.  Joe fired back, killing Alison.  Forensic tests later showed that Joe fired several shots in response to the one that Alison fired, emptying his gun into her.

- These events happened in the state of Iowa, where the following statute applies:

- 101.  Murder is the killing of a human being with malice aforethought.

- 101a.  Malice aforethought may be express or implied.  It is express when the actor deliberately and with premeditation intends to take the life of another.  It is implied when the actor consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a person will be killed because of the actor’s conduct.

- 102.  A killing that would otherwise be murder is voluntary manslaughter when the actor commits the killing as the result of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.

- 103.  A killing that would otherwise be criminal is justified when it is committed in self-defense.

- QUESTIONS WE WILL DISCUSS IN CLASS

- 1)  Can we prosecute Joe with murder?  How do we find out?

- Joe probably could be prosecuted for murder. He likely had express malice aforethought because of what he said to the bartender and because he brought a gun with him. He likely also had implied malice aforethought by barging into a room whose inhabitants he knew he would startled. 
	
- We need to find out what happened after each of Joe's shots. If he was safe and then killed his wife, he'd have no self defense defense.

- 2)  What story can we tell based on these facts and the statute?

- Perhaps despite the fact that Joe may have thought bad thoughts leading to the killing, he didn't commit murder since he may have acted in self defense.

- 3)  What defenses can Joe raise?

- Self defense
	- a type of "affirmative defense"
	- prosecution has to prove that it wasn't self defense beyond a reasonable
 doubt
	- elements:
		- threat
		- necessary and proportional force
		- aggressive act
		- immediate threat
	- defense must prove this at a preponderance
- lack of malice aforethought
