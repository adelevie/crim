#### People v. Scott
- Does intent transfer when Person A, unintentionally kills Person B, while attempting to intentionally kill Person C?
- Lot's of crossfire in domestic dispute in playground

#### Specific verse General Intent

#### People v. Atkins
- Drunken arson case
- D argued that evidence of vol. intox. was admiss. to show he lacked requisite mental state
