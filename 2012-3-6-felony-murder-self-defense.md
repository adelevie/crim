## Felony murder
- does not need to be foreseeable
- most jurisdiction require some causation
	- "but for" is easy to prove, in some places that's all you need to demonstrate causation
- strict liability murder, as long as you commit a felony

## Self defense
- affirmative defense: admit to the act, but it was legal because of some exception
	- typical burden of proof: defendant must show *preponderance*
		- differs from case in chief (prosecutor has to go beyond a *reasonable doubt*)
- types:
	1. Justification
		- ex. self defense
			- MPC has a purely subjective standard for this
	2. Excuse
		- more mitigation
		- focuses more on the defendant
		- ex. insanity

### Elements of Self Defense
- D must have honest (good faith [subjective]) and reasonable (objective usually, but has subjective tendencies) belief that he was threatened with an imminent threat of unlawful force
	- force D used was necessary to repel the threat and proportional

### Exception
- Initial aggressor loses the right to act in self defense

### People v. Goetz
- MPC uses "when the actor believes" => subjective
- But NY legis used the word reasonable => require's honest and reasonable belief

### Simon
- honest + objective (reasonable) belief
- issue: who is the reasonable person that we are comparing the defendant to?

### Hatori

- Does it really matter if it's subjective or a mixed subj/obj standard

### MPC 3.04(1)
- D must believe force is reasonable and necessary
