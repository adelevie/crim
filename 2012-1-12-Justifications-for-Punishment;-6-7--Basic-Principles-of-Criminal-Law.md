### Justifications for Punishment; 6-7

#### Consequentialist (Utilitarianism)

- Relies on *Utilitarianism*. Outcomes matter most.
- A utilitarian punishes, he looks forward to whether the benefits of punishment outweigh the costs of punishment. They examine the consequences of punishment.
- Could a utilitarian justify the punishment of an innocent person?
	- yes
- A utilitarian chooses the costs and benefits
- Four reasons to punish:
	- specific deterrence: pressure of unpleasant memories of incarceration set on an individual convict that deter him from crime.
	- general deterrence: the pressure onto that the example of one criminal's pain and suffering sets on the rest of society.
	- incapacitation: rendering someone harmless who is otherwise a threat.
	- rehabilitation

#### Non-consequentialist (Retributivism)

- Relies on *retributivism*. Certain actions are morally right or wrong, regardless of outcome. Looks backward and calibrates punishment to the crime.
- Do you deserve punishment? If yes, you will be punished.
- Punishment must be proportional.
- A retributivist *cannot* justify the punishment of an innocent individual.
- If you kill someone by complete accident, a retributivist will not punish you.
- Can you justify not punishing a child molester with an awful background?
	- yes

#### Experiences of Punishment Justified: Haven or Hell
- Incapacitation: rendering someone harmless who is otherwise a threat.
- Retribution: intentional infliction of pain and suffering because someone willingly committed a crime.
- General deterrence: the pressure onto that the example of one criminal's pain and suffering sets on the rest of society.
- Specific deterrence:  pressure of unpleasant memories of incarceration set on an individual convict that deter him from crime.
- Proportional punishment: an eye for an eye.
- *malum in se*: something bad in itself.
- *malum prohibitum*: something bad because it is defined as such.
- Inmates in Lorton usually said they did not consider the consequences before they committed their crimes.
