### Causation
- must be proven by state beyond reasonable doubt
	- among the other elements
- typically an issue for result crimes (murder), not conduct crimes (dui)

#### Actual Cause
- aka but for cause, cause in fact
- "but for" helps us ID who we might charge

##### Rementer
- Barry dies, Mr. M ignores her, runs over her
- p.285: you need both legal cause and actual cause
- actual cause: BUT FOR TEST

#### Proximate Cause
- policy based
- becomes an issue when we have intervening causes
	- must occur after D's act and before social harm, but contributes causally to the social harm
- superseding intervening cause cuts of D's liability
- is the intervening cause a coincidence or a response?
	- it's a coincidence when D's act merely puts victim at a certain place at a certain time, and because the victim was so located, it was possible for the victim to be acted upon by the intervening cause
	- a response doesn't break the chain of causation unless it is abnormal and unforeseeable

- coincidence vs. response test

##### voluntary human intervention test
- here, courts typically cut off liability

##### intended consequences doctrine
- did D achieve what he wanted to achieve even though it didn't occur in the intended manner
- ex. mom wanted to murder baby, gave nurse poison, told nurse it was medicine.
	- instead nurse left the bottle on the mantle
	- child found it, drank it, died
	- D says intervening cause is that kid took the bottle, drank it and died
	- Court found her guilty using this doctrin
