### Cleanup
- MPC uses but-for causation 2.03(1)
- Proximate causation 2.03(2)(b) and 2.03(3)(b)

#### Goban
- man voluntary shot gf with intent to kill
- woman died 5 yrs later from pneumonia
- no temporal concurrence, no problem
- just want temporal concurrence at the time of the attack, not the time of the death

## Homicide
- murder = killing + malice aforethought
- manslaughter = killing

### Malice Aforethought
- four ways to prove (only need one)
	- intent to kill (express malice)
	- implied malice:
		- intent to commit serious bodily injury
		- depraved heart (extreme recklessness)
		- felony murder applies

- MPC 2.10(1) - degrees of murder

- Does predetermination and deliberation work to separate the worst cases?
