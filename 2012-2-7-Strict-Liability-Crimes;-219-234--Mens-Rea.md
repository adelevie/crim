### Strict Liability Crimes; 219-234
- common law doesn't like strict liability crimes unless it is a violation of MPC
	- so what is a violation?
		- a crime for which the punishment is a fine 2.05(1)(a)
- 2.05(2)
	- applies in a jurisdiction that incorporates some parts of MPC
	- existing crime in this jurisdiction, and it's a felony
	- if we apply 2.05(2)(a), the default position is that this statute will be treated like a violation--if found guilty you only get a fine
	- 2.05(2)(b)
		- if you read in a culpability element and can prove individual acted negligently, then you can treat it as a crime and not a violation.
