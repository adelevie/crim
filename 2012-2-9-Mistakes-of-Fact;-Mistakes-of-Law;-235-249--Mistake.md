### Mistakes of Fact; Mistakes of Law; 235-249
- if crime was general intent,
	- defense:
		- if it was a reasonable mistake, he can present evidence of his mistaken beliefs
		- Bell
			- apply Moral Wrong Doctrine or Legal Wrong Doctrine

#### People v. Navarro
- man took pieces of lumber, claimed he thought it was worthless
- tussle over jury instructions
- how do you determine if D is allowed to testify that the would was abandoned?
	- is it general or specific intent crime?
		- if specific intent
			- we don't care if it's reasonable
			- we only care if it negates the specific intent portion of the crime
				- in this case, it did, because he did not commit specific act of intending to permanently deprive the owner
			- difference between good faith and reasonableness
				- what does Reasonable Man think vs. what does the actual D think

#### 2.04 Ignorance
- 2.04(1)(a)
	- the mistake as to matter of fact or law is defense in MPC if it negates mens rea required to establish a material element to the defense
- MPC utilizes elemental approach (v. culpability approach)
	- apply the mens rea term to every element of the offense

#### Bell v. State
- Bell charges w/ 1st Degree Prostitution, requires knowledge that women were minors
- Bell claims he didn't know she was under 16

##### Moral Wrong Doctrine
- Bell *actually* did this, can still convict in Prost. 1st Degree
- convict crime that he actually did, not what he thought he did
	if defendant.mistake.reasonable?
		if defendant.mistake.moral?
			defense
		else
			prosecute for what he actually did
		end
	else
		no defense
	end

#### Legal Wrong Doctrine

#### MPC 2.04(1)-(2) p. 991

### Mistake of Law

#### People v. Marrero
- D thought he was allowed to possess a weapon
- Can he raise a mistake of law defense under NY's mistake of law statute?
	- D says his mistaken belief is founded upon an official statement of the law contained the statute itself
		- court rejects this because (from statutory construction)
			- common law doesn't like mistake of law defenses out of policy reasons, we want to encourage people to know what the law is.
	- 2.04 p. 245 MPC version of mistake
