## Involuntary Manslaughter
- a form of unintentional homicide

### MPC 2.10 (p.1016)
- 2.10.2(1)(b)
	- equivalent of depraved heart murder; equivalent of felony murder
	- additional language of manifesting an extreme indifference of the value of human life
		- turns manslaughter into murder

- an accidental killing will either be depraved heart murder or invol. manslaughter.

- difference between involuntary manslaughter (crim) and civil negligence (tort)
	- different standards from different jurisdictions:
		- simple recklessness (highest)
		- gross negligence (higher)
		- civil standard

### Commonwealth v. Welanksy
- nightclub owner got sick and was in hospital
- fire at club while he's in hospital
- court emphasized he was the owner/operator of the club
	- awareness => duty
- convicted of involuntary manslaughter based on *wanton and wreckless conducts*
- mental state require for invol. m-slaughter in Mass.
- is there a difference between wanton and wreckless conduct and negligent and grossly negligent?
	- wanton and wreckless requires knowledge and a great risk
	- no such thing in Mass. as crim negligence (p. 367)
- def wanton and wreckless:
	- knowledge and appearance of a great risk
	- decision to ignore rather than mitigate
	- another definition:
		- failure to be aware can substitute awareness

### State v. Williams
- child neglect => death
- connection between mens rea and causation
	- 9/1 - 9/5: time when taking the child to the hospital would have saved his life
	- look at this period and ask *would a reasonable person have realized that they needed to take the baby to the hospital during this period of time?*

### MPC 2.10.4
- p. 1017
- doesn't speak in terms of involuntary manslaughter
- calls it negligent homicide:
	- guilty when you commit homicide negligently
		- negligently from 2.02 (higher standard than civil, you must be grossly negligent)
