## Four basic elements of criminal law - Actus Reus

### Actus Reus - Voluntary Act

### Concurrence of the elements - act must occurred with required mental state
- ex. you want to kill your brother and have bad mental state (intent to kill him). Then you run over someone totally by mistake. Turns out the person was your brother. Was there concurrence between the mental state and the act? 
	- it's an accident, not murder

### Martin v. State - Voluntary act
- public drunkenness case
- acts reuse: being drunk in a public place
- acts that statute requires: 
	- *appear* in a public place
	- manifest a drunken condition
- Court read between the lines to require that appearance must be voluntary
- The timeframe from which you view an event can determine whether or not you find a voluntary or involuntary act.

### Dalton Case (p. 141)
- Dalton arrested for writing fictional tales of child molestation and torture.
- Plead guilty.
- ACLU intervened for 1st Amendment Issues
- Trial court dismissed because statute only covered actual children, not fictional children.
- Plain language of statute could allow prosecution.

### Wisconsin v. Mitchell
- Does a hate crime statute punish Mitchell for his thoughts?
	- Judge holds that we're not determining guilt or innocence because of his thoughts.
	- Once we've determined that he's guilty, we're taking his thoughts into account for sentencing.
- Mitchell argues the increase in sentence is punishing his bigoted thoughts.
- You can't increase punishment for someone's *abstract beliefs*, but you can punish if the beliefs are related to the crime for purposes of sentencing.
- A racist who happens to commit a crime, no extra punishment for thoughts.
- A racist who commits a crime because of his thoughts, gets extra punishment for the thoughts.

### Model Penal Code ยง 2.01 (p. 988)
- Voluntary act requirement
	- describes acts that are *not* voluntary:
		- reflex or convulsion
		- bodily movement during sleep or unconsciousness
		- conduct during hypnosis
		- a bodily movement that otherwise is not a product of the effort or determination of the actor; either conscious or habitual.

### Decina Case (p. 148)
- Court held: Decina voluntarily decided to drive
	- Decina is the same as a drunk driver who hopes his driving won't be affected.
- Defense: no voluntary act; at the time he struck those girls with his car, there was no voluntary act (case in chief defense--arguing that prosecutor cannot prove all elements of the crime; in this case, he can't prove voluntary act requirement of actus reus).
	- difference here is choice of time frame
