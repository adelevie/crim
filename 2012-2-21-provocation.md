- modern approach:
	1. actually provoked
	2. reasonable provocation
	3. D didn't cool off
	4. response was what a reasonable person would do

	- reasonably provoked, runs to kill the driver in the heat of passion, good samaritan intervenes and blocks driver, killing good samaritan
	- misdirected retaliation
