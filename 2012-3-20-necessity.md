## Necessity Defense
- aka "necessary evil" defense
- we want people to break the law to promote a greater good
- affirmative defense
- defining harms is key to defining necessity
	- who should be defining this harm?
		- could be appellate court, jury ...

### Elements of Necessity Defense
- balance of harms
- causal connection
- imminence

#### Exceptions
- if there is a legal alternative, necessity is unavailable as a defense
- creation of the harm removes your right to use the necessity defense
- not a defense to homicide
	- does not apply to MPC (3.02 - Choice of Evils) jurisdictions
		- you could justify eating a man on a lifeboat
			- but does that mean the guy who's going to get eaten gives up his right to self defense?

### Problem with MPC
- D passes out drunk, wakes up, lying in a pool of his own blood, drunk drives to hospital
- Does he have MPC defense?
	- no. he created the harm by drinking.

### US v. Schoon
- indirect civil disobedience
- How did D frame harm they were trying to avoid?
	- avoid further bloodshed in El Salvador
- What is the harm of breaking obstruction of justice laws?
- Holding: Indirect civil disobedience

### Eichorn
- harm: lack of sleep
