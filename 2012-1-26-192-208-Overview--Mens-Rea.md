### Statutory interpretation p 
- "plain language" of statute must be respected
- determine *legislative intent*
- *noscitur a sociis*
- *ejusdem generis*

#### US v. Daury
- Daury arrested with pics from magazines
- statute punishes possession of 3 or more matter depicting minors engaging in sexual conduct
- jury was to decide if pictures were "laviscious"
- on appeal from conviction judgement, Daury argues:
	- wording is ambiguous, and should favor him
	- question on appeal: were the pics "other matter which contain any visual depiction"?
- held: appeals court reverse and dismisses indictment
	- plain meaning
		- dictionary definition of "to contain": to hold *or* to consist of
		- district court assumed both meanings without using *rules of construction*
		- definition of "other matter"
			- substance which a physical object is composed
		- film strip example: # of images not nec. critical
	- canons of construction
		- *noscitur a soccis*: meaning can come from a word's relationship to the other words near it
		- *ejusdem generis*: when general words follow an enumeration, the general words should be limited to the things specifically enumerate
			- magazine et al in the statue are picture containers, mag clippings are not pic containers
		- statutory structure
	- Legislative history: when the above don't work, resolve to this
- dissent:
	- ambiguity not nec. => lenity

#### United States v. Yermian
- 18 USC 1001 outlaws false statements. requires knowledge of the falsity.
- defendant (respondent) didn't disclose prior criminal conviction on employment application
	- admitted to actual knowledge of the falsity, but claimed he didn't know the info would go to a federal agency
- appeals court reverse conviction, holding defendant's proposed jury instruction was correct because "knowingly and willfully" modify "false statements" within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.
- issue: did congress intend "knowingly and willfully" to modify language of the statute?
- supreme court reverses appeals court because plain language and legislative history establish that proof of actual knowledge of a fed agency is not required.
- dissent:
	- court's reading is not compelled by the language of the statute

#### Holloway v. US
- carjacking, threaten with a gun, then hit someone when they refuse, but never shoot the gun at them
- statute outlaws carjacking with intent to kill
- issue: is the intent conditional?
- majority:
	- no. he had a gun, he threatened someone with it, he had intent
- dissent (scalia):
	- yes. he may not have followed through with his threat.
