### Statutory interpretation p 
- "plain language" of statute must be respected
- determine *legislative intent*
- *noscitur a sociis*
- *ejusdem generis*

#### US v. Daury
- Daury arrested with pics from magazines
- statute punishes possession of 3 or more matter depicting minors engaging in sexual conduct
- jury was to decide if pictures were "laviscious"
- on appeal from conviction judgement, Daury argues:
	- wording is ambiguous, and should favor him
	- question on appeal: were the pics "other matter which contain any visual depiction"?
- held: appeals court reverse and dismisses indictment
	- plain meaning
		- dictionary definition of "to contain": to hold *or* to consist of
		- district court assumed both meanings without using *rules of construction*
		- definition of "other matter"
			- substance which a physical object is composed
		- film strip example: # of images not nec. critical
	- canons of construction
		- *noscitur a soccis*: meaning can come from a word's relationship to the other words near it
		- *ejusdem generis*: when general words follow an enumeration, the general words should be limited to the things specifically enumerate
			- magazine et al in the statue are picture containers, mag clippings are not pic containers
		- statutory structure
	- Legislative history: when the above don't work, resolve to this
- dissent:
	- ambiguity not nec. => lenity
